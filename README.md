# Getting Started

Hello and welcome to EPMQ/ML!

In this repository you will find a list of tutorials and exercises intented to give you a brief introduction to topics and tools related to software development, data science and machine learning. Each section contains a set of alternative links to teach the respective concept, meaning that you do not need to watch all of them.

Most of these tutorials and exercises use python. You can download a suitable version for your machine from the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org). We recommend downloading at least version 3.8 or later.


## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Bellow is a list of suggested IDEs to use, both are free (or offer a free licence for students) to use and contain various functionalities and plugins to ease you development. However, you can always use any IDE of your choice if you prefer one not listed here.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Free)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (PyCharm Community is free | Pycharm Professional has a [Free Educational License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) for students)

### Useful libs and docs

This subsection provides some useful libraries to write clean and concise code.

- [Pylint - Static code analyser](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
- [Poetry - Python packaging and dependency management made easy](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

### Virtual Environments

This subsection contains two largely used python virtual environments managers. Virtual environments are usefull when working with multiple projects to isolate the package dependencies and avoid version conflict between projects. **We strongly recommend that you use one of these tools**. For beginners, Anaconda might be easier to use since it provides a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Apache Spark

Spark has become popular due to its ability to process large data sets at speed. By default, Spark is multi-threaded, executing code in a distributed way. Also, Spark is lazy, which means it will only execute when you collect (ie. when you actually need to return something), and in the meantime it builds up an execution plan and finds the optimal way to execute your code.
